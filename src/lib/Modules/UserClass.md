# User and Posts Module Documentation

## Overview
This module provides a structure and functionality for user and post management in a web application. It includes two main classes: `User` and `Posts`, both of which interact with a Pocketbase backend.

## Dependencies
- Pocketbase: This module imports `pb` from a local library to interact with the Pocketbase backend.

## Classes

### `UserData` Interface
- **Purpose**: Represents the structure of user data.
- **Properties**:
  - `id` (string): Unique identifier for the user.
  - `username` (string): The user's username.
  - `email` (string): The user's email address.
  - `handle` (string): A unique handle for the user.
  - `avatar` (File): The user's profile picture.
  - `verified` (boolean): Indicates if the user's account is verified.

### `User` Class
- **Purpose**: Represents a user and their associated data and operations.
- **Properties**:
  - `user` (UserData): The user's data.
  - `posts` (any): The user's posts.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the `user` property with the current authenticated user's data and sets up a new `Posts` instance.
- **Methods**:
  - `get()`: Returns the user's data.

### `Posts` Class
- **Purpose**: Handles operations related to posts.
- **Properties**:
  - `user` (UserData): The user associated with the posts.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the `user` property with the current authenticated user's data.
- **Methods**:
  - `async create(post: any)`: Creates a new post. Returns a record of the created post or an error message if no post is provided.
  - `async like(post: any)`: Likes a post. Returns a record of the like action.
  - `async unlike(post: any)`: Unlikes a post. Returns a record of the unlike action.
  - `get()`: Returns the posts of the current user. Returns an error message if no user is provided.

## Usage
This module is designed to be used in a web application where users can create, like, and unlike posts. The user data is managed through the `User` class, while post-related operations are handled by the `Posts` class.

## Notes
- Error handling: The module currently returns simple strings for error messages. Consider enhancing error handling for production use.
- Data validation: Ensure proper validation of input data to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Asynchronous operations: Methods in the `Posts` class are asynchronous and return promises.
